            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                     <p>All men know that man is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of a twofold Nature, that is to
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:63969:25"/>ſay a <hi>Celeſtial</hi> and <hi>Aetherial,</hi> as the <hi>Rational ſoul,</hi> and a <hi>corpus, carducum mortale,</hi> a mortal, frail body com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of the Elements; therefore being agitated, and acted from theſe two different principals, to wit, the Celeſtial infiux, and the humane wil, it comes to paſs that his operations are rendred, mixed and various.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Tract, Signs,</hi> and footſteps of which operations our <hi>Chiroſcopia</hi> doth not obſcurely demonſtrate to every judicious eye, <hi>cum igitur (teſte Philoſopho primo de coelo &amp; mundo) Deus &amp; Natura nihil efficiant fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtra,</hi> ſeeing that God and Nature have made nothing in vain, <hi>id eſt, Natura Naturans &amp; natura natura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta, Haec que propoſitio univerſalis, non ſolum a Philoſophis verum &amp; a Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logis approbatur,</hi> this being a recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved maxime, both with <hi>Philoſophers</hi> and <hi>Divines, Sequitur non temere &amp; fruſtra lineas in manibus hominum eſſe impreſſ a preſertim quia ex influxu celeſti, &amp; ipſius microcoſmi principiis dependet:</hi> It follows then, that not inconſiderately and in vain are ſuch various Lines impreſſed in the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:63969:26"/>hands of men and women, princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally ſeeing that they depend on the celeſtial influence, and the principals of the <hi>Microcoſm.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But farther to remove that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting and vulgar opinion of them which ſay, that the lines of the hand are cauſed by the conſtriction and plication thereof.</p>
                     <p>The falcity of which opinion, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one may more clear then the Sun diſcern by his own hands, for can one and the ſame plication or folding of the hand conſtitute Stars, Triangles, Quadrangles, Croſſes and marks of ſeveral different forms in the hand? neither is their two men in ten thouſand that in all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects have the lines in their hards alike, although they uſe one and the ſame exerciſe with their hands: Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for refutation of this error, we ſee Nature hath impreſſed lines in the forehead, which is not capable of reſtriction or plication; therefore this cannot hold that the <hi>conſtriction</hi> of the hands ſhould cauſe the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation or appearance of the Lines in the hands, for in the <hi>Condils,</hi> between
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:63969:26"/>the joynts of the fingers, many have many Lines, and of different forms, others very ſew or none at all, and here is no flexation, conſtriction or plication, and oft-times are lines tranſverſe, circular, and cemicircu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar between the joynts of the fing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, where no conſtriction is of the hand. Which is ſufficient to ſilence any Antagoniſt: Furthermore this truth is confirmed by <hi>Aſtrology,</hi> for <hi>Chiromancy</hi> and <hi>Aſtrology</hi> prove the <hi>verity</hi> each of other, for let the Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loger conſidering the Nativity of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny one, obſerve the nature of good fortune to come to that perſon thereby, to the ſame end and ſence will it appear to the Chiromancer by obſerving and judging the hand, which hath been much <hi>delightful</hi> to me in my Obſervations; therefore where I can have the Nativity of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny one under examination, I will if poſſible, ſubjoyn my Chiromantick obſervations, for I have very oft ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced, that what the Nativity ſhall ſignifie, the Chiromantick ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of the hand ſhall confirm, and ratify, as thus, if the Aſtrologer
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:63969:27"/>by the Scheam of heaven radically conſidered, finde the Native ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected to ill fortune, the ſame will appear in the hand, by conſidering the proper ſignifications of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per parts thereof; beſide ſhall Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy in the Nativity find any Planet more then ordinarily ſavourable to the Native, or more favourable then another, let the Chiromantiſt conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the proper place of that Planet in the hand, and he ſhall find it beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified and adorn'd with ſignificant Lines to that purpoſe, and ſo on the contrary.</p>
                     <p>Another vulgar <hi>error</hi> fit to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, is, that it is by ſome affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med that the right hand, others the left ought to be inſpected.</p>
                     <p>To which I anſwer, <hi>Noste etiam natis ſiniſtra magis favet, die vero &amp; in aurora natis dextra, quamvis utra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que manus probe inſpicienda &amp; exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minanda eſt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To thoſe perſons born in the night the left hand is of moſt ſignification, to thoſe born in the day, or by day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, the right hand is moſt obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable, yet both are ſeriouſly to
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:63969:27"/>be impected and examined.</p>
                     <p>Thus it is apparent that, <hi>Chiro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mancy, eſt ars recte divinandi ex line<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>is manuum,</hi> that Chiromancy or Palmiſtry is an Art which rightly draws its concluſions from the lines of the hand, rightly I ſay, that is not prepoſterouſly lightly, and raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as ignorant Rogues do, but <hi>Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedly</hi> with Judgement and Reaſon, obſerving the cauſes and ground from whence every line deduceth its Original.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Subject</hi> of our judgement is the hand impreſſed with Lines, for you ſhall never ſee the hand of any one living void of lines.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Next, its requiſite to ſubjoyn cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain neceſſary notions, fit and conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to be obſerved before giving of judgement.</hi>

                        <item>2. Next let the hands be decent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly waſht and clean, and a little reſt after taken to compoſe the parts, and with an empty ſtomack, that is not overcharg'd with Gluttony and Drunkenneſs; in the Summer time in a place not over hot, in Winter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time in a place not too extream cold, nor in a place where the Sun-beams are violent, becauſe the natural heat is extracted thereby, and the inward powers debillitated, the skin grows red, and the viſive Organs and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits are reſolved by the Suns Rayes, let not the hand or body be over wearied with labour, becauſe heat draweth out the blood and the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits from the Center, to the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, and in a clear and inoffenſive light.</item>
                        <item>3. In the next place is neceſſarily conſiderable, the <hi>Sex, Age, State, Condition,</hi> and <hi>Exerciſe,</hi> for all theſe are obſervable, and do not a little help or hinder the ſignification; of the Lines.</item>
                        <item>4. Conſider the hands in which
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:63969:28"/>the lines are moſt obvious and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous, for uſually the <hi>right</hi> hand is moſt apparent of them which are born in the day, and by day-light, and the <hi>left</hi> of them which are born in the night; obſervation of the hands is to be made from the four principal lines, and others viſible in either hand conteyned.</item>
                        <item>5. Next are to be noted the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours of the lines, for paleneſs com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly denoteth an evil tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of body, in thoſe lines which look otherwiſe coloured, for redneſs in ſome lines ſignifies evil, and pale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs good.</item>
                        <item>6. Its very conſiderable that the uſual temper of womens hands is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt by imperfect lines by reaſon of the exility of heat, but if the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary happen, that they have ſtrong lines well and clearly expreſt, that woman is to be judged a Virago, if not worſe, for its proper for a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man to have imperfect lines; But on the contrary, if a man have ſoft hands, flaccid, faint or withered, ſmooth and ſhattered lines ſcarce appearing he is effeminate, timidus,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:63969:29"/>and too much inclining to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of women, but it is to be noted that we ſpeak of a hand render and Effeminate, beſides the condition of the perſon, otherwiſe to ſome ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly bred, a tender ſmall near hand is a grace, and comly.</item>
                        <item>7. The quantity of the hand is to be noted whether it bears an apt proportion to the body, in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner is to be underſtood of the lines, bearing a fit proportion they denote holdneſs, and a good temperament, but if the hands be ſhorter, longer, or ſmaller then the due proportion, its an argument of Cavillers, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentious, Crafty, and Malignant ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, the fingers over ſhort denote Theft, and a Man full of Malignity, a long Palm with groſs fingers, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notes one dull, heavy, and fatuous: a woman having a ſhort hand, notes to her pain and difficulty in child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearing; long ſlender hands, denote Tyranny, by reaſon of the exceſs of choller, hair in a mediocrity on the back of the hands denote a good temperament and ingenuity, but if they over much abound, the perſon
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:63969:29"/>in condition is flaſhy, light, and of much inſtability.</item>
                        <item>8. Next is obſervable whether the line or lines be continued, or ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt, for if it be contrarily effected to what is requiſite, it leſſens the ſignification, for ſo it comes to paſs that continuity diminiſheth the ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification in adverſe things.</item>
                     </list>
                     <p>Laſtly, it remains to note, that the lineaments of the hand cannot be ſo exquiſitely taken that they may exactly be graven, its poſſible they may a little evariate in poſition or figure, and the ſignification abide, neither can it for a light or ſmall diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimillitude or diſconguity be dimini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed in efficacy.</p>

                     <p>But before we come to the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular demonſtration of the ſignes of long or ſhort life, its neceſſary to propoſe theſe eight following gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral rules.</p>
                     <list>
                        <item>
                           <hi>Firſt,</hi> When it haps that the vital line, or line of life, be disjoyn'd or diſcontinued, and that diſcontinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the branches, extend towards the mount of the thumb, and there deſiſt or end, it ſheweth the period or term of life there to end, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:63969:55"/>to the dimenſions of the hand, in the meaſure of time before trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of, although the <hi>Saturnine</hi> line be continued, and many other good marks appear in the hand.</item>
                        <item>
                           <hi>Secondly,</hi> When the line of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn</hi> ſuffers a fraction, and is broken off in the hollow of the hand, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it touch the natural line, and there appear branches in or near the Natural line, its alwayes a fignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of eminent peril of death, by reaſon of ſome infirmity, or Acro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick diſtemper, and it is a receau'd o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion that circular figures in the Natural Line, intimate murther, yet there be very few, that well, or any whit underſtand this poſition.</item>
                        <item>
                           <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Its to be noted that the <hi>Saturnine</hi> line moſt commonly ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyes the place of the vital line, prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally when it is bowed and reflex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed towards the ſuperiour part of the wriſt, above the mount of the thumb; and the Natural line ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth in or againſt the place of that fraction, inclining towards the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turnine</hi> line, and when the <hi>Saturnine</hi> line by circumflexion which it
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:63969:55"/>makes about the mount, inclines to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the inferiour part of the wriſt, it ſignifies the longer life.</item>
                        <item>
                           <hi>Fourthly,</hi> It is to be noted that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the roots of the fingers, are thoſe lines and Characters that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>note hurts and wounds in the whole body, as thoſe in the root of the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dex</hi> or forefinger, ſhew hurts or wounds on the head, on the <hi>Midle finger,</hi> on the breaſt, on the <hi>Ring-fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,</hi> wounds and hurts about the reynes, on the <hi>Auricular</hi> or <hi>little-fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger</hi> thoſe wounds that may hap to the Arms, Hands, Leggs and Feet, the parts of the body are to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, according to the poſition of the Characters before named, as they incline to one part more then another, as thoſe marks about the forefinger, if they appear about the midle of the root, of the finger, then they ſhew wounds on the head, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the hinder part, the <hi>Occiput;</hi> If they appear on the lower part of the mount towards the midle finger, then they denote wounds towards the forehead, or neck, and by ſo much as they incline nearer the midle

                        <item>
                           <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Thoſe lines figurated in the vital line, as they conſtitute di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers forms, ſo they have different ſignifications, when they make a long form, and are not like trenches, but appear as a formal line ſo far as they go, theſe ſignifie wounds by Iron, if circular or ſemicircular, then wounds are generally ſignified, if like trenches in the vital line, they ſignifie blows or hurts by ſome other means, but leſſe perilous, as to the matter of life, but if they appear, not ſquare or long, but like pits, or holes, and look withal red, then they ſignifie blows, or wounds in the head or death.</item>
                        <item>
                           <hi>Sixthly,</hi> Many are miſtaken in the terms of <hi>Tumida,</hi> or ſwelling, and <hi>Groſſa,</hi> or broad belonging to the lines, ſuppoſing theſe terms to ſignify one and the ſame thing, when as they much differ in their ſignificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, a line is ſaid to be groſſe when it is deep, and when it keeps the ſame latitude in the ſuperficies, as it hath in its profundity, but a line is ſaid to be tumid or ſwelling, which hath ſomewhat of depth, and ſpreads in
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:63969:57"/>the ſuperficies, and is dilated to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the palm, the natural line poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly may be found tumid in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning and end, and hath in either, in a manner the ſame ſignification, but if it be tumid in the beginning, it hath the more malevolent ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, it ſignifies blood, and that the party ſhal deſperately wound others, but when in this tumiddity there appear little trenches, ſomewhat circular and of evil appearance, this ſignifies murther, and the more of theſe marks, the more murthers are fignified; The ſame evil is ſignified when the ſupream angle is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what disjoyn'd or ſeparate, and that ſpace ſeems to be <hi>Caellous</hi> with cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain little Foſſulaes, or trenches, of which let every one beware,</item>
                        <item>
                           <hi>Seventhly,</hi> We are to underſtand, that as oft, and whereſoever we find the principal lines <hi>Bifurcated,</hi> they commonly ſhew duplicity of heart &amp; mind, and chiefly according to the ſignification and nature of thoſe lines yet this hath not alwayes its ſignification, for whenſoever the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal line is forked in the beginning,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:63969:57"/>it ſignifies Honeſty, Juſtice, and Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity, the reaſon is, becauſe it ſhews a man <hi>Callid</hi> Aſtute, and ſecret in his carriage; but when the vital line is forked in the end, it is not much commended by the Maſters of this Science, the Reaſon is becauſe, in the beginning of the vital line, the firſt and ſecond age of man are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated, in which times the power and virtue of natural heat a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounds, by which means, they are ſtrong, and will not permit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be occupied in ſordid and vile actions, becauſe the vigour and virtue of natural heat predominates, humidity, and frigidity which are the cauſes of infirm, weak actions, and inſtability in youth, which vigor is not retain'd in age, from whence it comes, that they that have the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal line forked in the end; in youth, are rendred unfaithful, unſtable, and not to be truſted as ſerious friends, for this <hi>Bifurcation</hi> at the end, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notes much frigidity, which is onely proper for age, therefore in age this betokens good, becauſe it denotes a refrenation from raſh actions, and
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:63969:58"/>the temper moſt proper for age.</item>
                        <item>
                           <hi>Eightly,</hi> The Liver line in any manner forked at the ends, ſignifies alwayes evil, becauſe it denotes, an evil Complexion, and an impotency of Natural heat, from whence pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds malignity, and double decep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious dealing.</item>
                        <item>
                           <hi>Ninthly,</hi> The Natural line for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked towards the percuſſion of the hand, fignifies alwayes evil, and if it be not by little branches united to the vitall line in the ſupream angle, it implies a laborious, and a trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome life.</item>
                        <item>
                           <hi>Tenthly,</hi> And laſtly, we are to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member &amp; heed, that whenſover we obſerve any line that indicates long or ſhort life, we are to have recourſe to the vital line, according to which proportion, comparatively the line is to be judged, as we have taught in the rules of menſuration, thus for in generall.</item>

                     <hi>Of Aſtrological Elections.</hi> Diſcovering thoſe things about which the Doctrine of Elections is converſant, and within what limits the truth thereof is bounded.</head>
                  <p>THe Doctrine of Elections con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in the finding out fit, apt, and congruent times, for the ſhun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and avoyding of Evil ſignified to any Perſon in his Nativity, or feared, and the accompliſhment and obtaining of that Good, which is promiſed, or deſired, as alſo for the right directing of all Actions (in the Humane life of Man) to a good awiſhed and deſired end,) therefore Elections differ from <hi>Horary</hi> queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which reſt and determine in the knowledge of the thing <hi>Sought,</hi> but Elections in reference to their diſpo ſing ends, referr unto future Actions.</p>
                  <p>Elections in their conſtitution,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:63969:104"/>offers themſelves to us under a double conſideration: The firſt hath its ground from the Radical Nativi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Perſon, for whom the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection is made, is grounded there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon and conſimulates therewith, and this is the moſt Legitimate and true ground, of forming Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as being certain and ſure; from whence may be diſcerned the great Utility, the knowledge of a mans Nativity conduceth to him, in his diſpoſal of Humane Actions.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond ground is, the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity of the perſon being not known, to form your Election on general grounds, or build them on a Horary queſtion: This ground is much more weake, and invalid then the former, and admits of much uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty: the Learned much contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert this point, but the ſumme is, that in a figure of Election of time, though it be in ſignification apa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently moſt happy, yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, if it be contrary to the Radical figure of the Nativity, not known, it will produce little or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of Good, but rather the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:63969:104"/>will prove unfortunate; for perhaps the Horoſcope of the time Elected, may be the Signe of the eight, or twelfth Houſes in the Radi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Poſition of Heaven: I'ts poſſible a Man may Elect to himſelf, a moſt fortunate and happy hour to begin a Journey, or Voyage, in reſpect of the preſent General ſtate and Poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Heavens, yet may he begin his Journey in a moſt unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py time in reference to his Life, goods and Eſtate; whilſt another making choice apparently of an unfortunate and unlucky time, may every way experience good Fortune and Felicity, the reaſon is becauſe to many in their Nativitys the Malevolent, and unfortunate Planets (as we call them) are ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficators of Life, Dignity, and Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and well affected, &amp;c. and the Benevolent and fortunate Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets are Significators of Evils to them and Evil affected, and ſo to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers the contrary; therefore <hi>Haly</hi> Exhorts that no Election be made for him, of whoſe Nativity thou art Ignorant, unleſs (ſaith he) thou
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:63969:105"/>haſt a ground from the aſcendant of his queſtion, <hi>Haly</hi> ſeems to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade that the time of a Horary queſtion is Equivalent to the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity; as to the Election of time for any Action, but by his leave we hold not this ſo Legitimate a ground for a good Election.</p>

From whence that Houſe may be
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:63969:106"/>rendred Unhappy to him that oweth or enjoys it, and the ſame Reaſon we may conceive in all other things.</p>
                     <p>In like manner he that would prevent an Eminent Diſeaſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignified by the Stars to him, Hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing found the time thereof by Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections, and the Revolutions of Sun and Moon, may chooſe a fit time by this Art before the Diſeaſe invade Nature in which he may let Blood if neceſſary, or ſafely Purge thoſe Noxious Humors afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                     <p>As alſo a King fearing War from another Prince, may hereby before the beginning of the War, take up thoſe grounds and reſolutions, by conſulting a fit and proper time of acting, and by conſulting with, and acting by thoſe men that are fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately affected and diſpoſed, conſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liate a laudable Peace, or proſper in a fortunate &amp; honourable War; the ſame reaſon is of any eminent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie in which life or goods are concerned, and the event feared.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, any Man may as for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, ſo for any other Perſon Elect a

                     <p>Thirdly for the making an apt and fit Election of time for the more happy Contracting of Matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony. Theſe two things are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired. Firſt, that the Nativity have good Signification of Marriage. Secondly, That the time of the Contract, or Marriage be backt
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:63969:107"/>with congruent Directions, Revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions, and Tranſits of the Radical Significators: either of theſe failing. Election profiteth not much, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it ſeemingly promiſe never ſo much good Fortune; for Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are not able to <hi>avert,</hi> the Radi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Significations, nor truely the Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dical Directions, and Revolutions.</p>
                     <p>The Radical Significations may be conſidered in a <hi>Supreans,</hi> an <hi>Infime,</hi> and a <hi>Mediate</hi> Degree, as alſo the Significations of Elections <hi>ad a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendum,</hi> reſpecting Action; as if thoſe grounds taken form the Nativity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree with the Rules of Election; in the ſupream &amp; higheſt degree, great, and quick ſhall the effects following be, conformable to either ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; if in the Infime and loweſt degree, it ſhall be the meaner, or as it were Fortunate in appearance only: if in the Mediate degree the effects ſhall be anſwerable proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onably; the Superlative degree of the one, with the inferior degree of the other, ſhall produce ſomething more then the capacity of the Low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt degree wil admit, and with the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:63969:108"/>mediate degree above the <hi>Medium,</hi> cheifly if the Supream degree be taken from the Natal Significa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     <p>The fourth principal of this Doctrine referring to Practice; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in this: that thoſe things which we intend to do, and act in, are to be begun in that moment of time, ſignified by the Caeleſtial, Elective conſtitution of the Heavens; for the whole vertue of an Election, conſiſts in that very proper Poſition of the Heavens, which is made choice of, conformable and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruent to the end of the thing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended; otherwiſe the virtue is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved, by a continued motion of the Heavens, and your deſired, and wiſhed ſucceſs is loſt and periſhed. As for Example, to Elect a time to make a Fortunate Journey or Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, The ninth houſe is to be For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified, by the Poſition of fortunate Planets therein, which by a little delay of time &amp; the <hi>ſwift</hi> motion of the Heavens; all thoſe Significators are devolved into the Eight Houſe, where Death and Danger of life is
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:63969:108"/>portended: and in like manner thoſe fortunate Poſitions of the Planets, which are Located in the firſt Houſe for the health &amp; <hi>Sanity</hi> of body and minde, are quickly by the ſwift foot of time revolved into the Twelfth Houſe, which hath the ſignification of Miſchiefs &amp; Diſeaſes; &amp; therefore ſeeing the whole conſiſts in that ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of proper time Elected, all things relating to the buſineſs in hand, ought to be made ready, and prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that nothing be to be done; but to obſerve the exact Moment of time, which is not to be taken by common vulgar Clocks and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als, which ofttimes vary half an hour or more from the true time; but by the Sun or Stars, or ſome exact Clock or Watch rectified thereby: ſo having all things prepared ready to that Moment intended, right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhall he be called <hi>Maſter</hi> of <hi>Time,</hi> which knows how thus to uſe it to his own liking and benefit: Thus is the uſe of a Figure of Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which is a particular Figure.</p>

                     <p>THe Doctrine of Elections is of ſo great Utility, if rightly appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended, that the practick good and benifit of all Aſtrology, is found com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended the rein; for to no other end is the Science of the Stars given to Men, by the moſt Great and wiſe God, then this, that the <hi>Evil</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending Men, ſignified in their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivityes, they might foreſee and ſhun, and the <hi>Good</hi> the Heavens promiſe, they might readily with deligence imbrace. Thus men have within there own capacitys, a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural rule and direction, for all their Human undertakings, adoring the diſpenſation of Divine Providence by the Stars, in all Sublunaries, and admiting the power of free will, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the influence of the Stars:
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:63969:109"/>Thus certainly ſo large as is the field of Human Actions, ſo capari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous is the Utility and Profit of <hi>Elections.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Of what great worth and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment is <hi>Aſtrology,</hi> and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally that part thereof, <hi>viz.</hi> The Doctrine of <hi>Elections,</hi> as to the undertaking and management of the greateſt and weightieſt affairs, may evidently be gathered from multitude of inſtances in all ages, and in particular, from the conſtant and ſure practice of the moſt po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Prince, the King of <hi>China;</hi> the management of whoſe great and weighty affairs, are wholly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by Himſelf, and a Privy Counſel conſiſting of twelve men, which are choſen out of the ableſt and wiſeſt in all His Kingdom; no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Wiſdom gives them ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittance to this ſo great a dignity, and not one of theſe is admitted, which is not a moſt excellent and ſingular <hi>Aſtrologer;</hi> for in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to all humane affairs, he in his Counſel conſults the <hi>Stars,</hi> as well of the thing to be done, of the

                     <p>I cannot, but conſent to, and much honour the opinion of the Learned <hi>Morinus,</hi> who ſaith, he really believes, and certainly
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:63969:110"/>knows, that nothing could be more profitable, and of greater utility to the King, or chief Magiſtrate in any Countrey, than to have of his private Counſel, three at leaſt of the moſt expert skilful and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced <hi>Aſtrologers,</hi> who might conſider and conſult the true Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vities, not onely of the King, Prince, or chief Magiſtrate, but alſo of thoſe neareſt to him, of his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour Princes, of all the great men and conſpicuous perſons belonging to the Court, and aſpiring after Dignities; from hence ſhould be known, from what King or State, and when, to ſhun War, againſt what Prince, and when, to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take War: And who would be fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt (amongſt his Nobles) to make a fortunate General, to be choſen to lead his Armies, and who to be refuſed; infinite good and benefit muſt needs accrue to any State by this means, is Rationally evident. When on the contrary ſide very oft it falls out that War is undertaken by an unfortunate Prince, and in the conſequence tends more to the

                     <p>To return from whence we Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſed; But becauſe it oft time falls out that neither the <hi>King,</hi> his chief Officers nor Miniſters, nor indeed the generality of perſons, take any care of obtaining the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivities of thoſe perſons, with whom they are moſt concern'd in buſineſſes; therefore it comes to paſs, notwithſtanding fit and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruent
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:63969:114"/>Elections, be properly made from the Geniture of the King, his chief Miniſters and Officers: yet ſometimes it ſo falls out, that they are diſappointed of the hoped for, and expected good ſucceſs deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; for the Kings Miniſter hath up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on himſelf, the fortune, or unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune of his Prince whom he ſerves, and the King and his Vicegerent have between themſelves the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, and the unfortune of thoſe perſons, whom actively they im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy to manage their affairs, &amp; exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute their commands, wherefore the proper fortune, or infortune of the Prince, in the common concourſe of affairs depends upon them im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed therein: Therefore all theſe Conſiderations, (according to art) are to be inſpected, and rightly ballanced in judgement, for advancing the more certain predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the event, no otherwiſe than are mixed together the influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of many Planets concurring to one, and the ſame effect: But if the Geniture of ſubordinate per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, ſerving in any deſign cannot
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:63969:114"/>be known, then let onely be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, what the Stars, (in reference to their Nativities) of the Prince or chief Commander do preſage, in that year by Directions, or Revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and alſo by the Tranſits that Day, and the Hour of a fit Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, if nothing more can with convenience be done, or known, its better to know ſo far, then to be ignorant of all: This knowledge as it tends to the creating confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and boldneſs in the hearts and ſpirits of the Actors, ſo it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiteth much more, than injoyning and preſcribing cautions from more ignote cauſes, and grounds.</p>
                     <p>The ſame is Applicable to the chief General of any Army, and to all his inferior Officers; as alſo to all which ſerve and ſubmit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the will of another, or commit their own affairs to the hands of another; for in all mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of great and conſiderable mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, its better for a man to know the Heavens favor his deſigns, than, not to know it, or to know the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, it will increaſe Valour and
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:63969:115"/>Courage; for ſuppoſe two Generals, or Princes ingag'd in Battail one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the other, now if either of theſe, knew that in the time of Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tail the Heavens would propitiouſly favour him, although he know no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the contrary but that the influences may equally favour the Adverſary, yet he will fight more audaciouſly and boldly; but moſt ſafe it is to have the knowledge of the enemies Nativity, and from a judicial inſpection of both, he might chooſe a time propitious to himſelf, and Adverſe to his enemy; then might that King whom the Caeleſtial influences moſt favour, certainly expect the Victory; yet ſo underſtood, that he add his own endeavour, and Cooperate with that fortunate Caeleſtial influence.</p>
                     <p>Farthermore we are to know, that amongſt thoſe acts which the Caeleſtial bodies particularly ſignifie to any one; to the effecting of which, a man may be ſaid to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute nothing of his own, but is meerly paſſive in the act, as when a man unawares falls from a High
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:63969:115"/>and dangerous place, or falls among Theives, or receives ſome benefit or Dignity from the King, of which he had no thoughts, nor expectation; theſe things as to good and bad, are only brought to paſs to man, by the Malevolent, or benevolent Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of his Stars.</p>
                     <p>Other Actions there are to which the Stars excite, ſtir up, and invite the minde of man, but yet not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce a perfection of the thing, but require a Cooperative power of the perſon to be joyned therewiith, in reference to the accompliſhment and end, of which ſort are contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies, Wars, Negotiations, and all things in Nature that concerne a man as to Action: for as the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven is in it ſelf, the moſt perfect I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of God, <hi>in ſuo agendi modo;</hi> as Philoſophy doth abundantly Dilu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidate, &amp; as their Natural Influence is moſt like to the Supernatural Influence of God which is called Grace: For as God by his Grace and ſpirit exciteth the will to Act, not compelling it, nor ſubjecting it to himſelf, or finiſhing the Action
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:63969:116"/>himſelf, but a free Cooperation of man is required herunto, which God leaves to the free will of man: even ſo the Heavens by a particular In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence, ſtirreth up, and exciteth a man <hi>ad Agendum</hi> as to Action, not forcing, or compelling him, nor per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting the work of it ſelf, but the Cooperation of mans will, and power is requiſite hereunto, which whilſt this Cooperation of man is congruent, and conformable to the Caeleſtial Influence, the effect falls out either good, or bad, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the quality of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence, but if the Cooperation of man be contrary to the Caeleſtial Influence, or work not therewith, no Influence towards him ſhall have its effect, as by it ſelf.</p>
                     <p>From hence is manifeſt the great Deception of them, who ſo far preſume upon Aſtrology, that they confidently beleive, that faeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city and good ſucceſs promiſed to them by the Stars, muſt needs Crown all their undertakings, though they do nothing at all, or Incongruently Act, ſuppoſing it e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough,

                        </gap> it fall out otherways, then they think Aſtrology to be falſe and unſufficient, or themſelves to be deceived by the Aſtrologer, when as the Aſtrologer by predict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing good ſucceſs to the Native in his Actions and Liberal undertak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, preſuppoſeth a Congruent compliance, and indeavour to the utmoſt, in the Native, for the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment of that end, who by Prudence may Avert and ſhun that Evil premonitated by the Stars, as alſo by his Negligence, and Impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence may obſtruct that good, and bereave himſelf, of that felicity promiſed him by the Heavens, for the Aſtrologer is not held in every point to the Nicety of the ſucceſs of his Prediction, it ſufficeth that he predict according to Art, and the Active Influence of the Stars: for in truth the Stars by their Influen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces incline men to this, or that, and to what they incline, may be truly predicted, but then what depends on mans will, as to Liberal and free
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:63969:117"/>Actings (by reaſon he may in ſome meaſure hinder, or farther their op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perations being a free Agent in Human things) can be predicted conjecturally, in reference to the future.</p>
                     <p>Seeing that Aſtrology conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant about theſe things, is at leaſt to a Human Genus, but only a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectural Science, as alſo for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differency of free will, to this, or that, or either, as alſo for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, and concurrence of other Cauſes oftime free, and tyed to no neceſſity, which how they are af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected by the Caeleſtial Influences, is unknown, although the greateſt part of mankinde, in their Actings follow their innate propenſions, (which much conduceth to a right and ſafe Prediction) yet there are many, who out of Prudence, Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, Coaction, Captivity, or ſever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al other conditions elude the Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the Stars, and of theſe more Caution is to be uſed in Predicting, conſideration being ſeriouſly had, as to their eſtate and condition: theſe things I thought good, here
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:63969:117"/>to appoſe that it may appear how great care, and Sagacity is requiſit in an Aſtrologer in predicting future Events, ſeeing that in Liberal Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, by reaſon of mans free will, nothing can certainly, infallibly, and definitively be reſolved, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conjecturally, yet notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the more certainty and probability as the ability of the Aſtrologer is the greater and the Influence of the Heavens of more vallid Signification.</p>
                     <p>But to return let all men avidus of Predictions be ſo far admoniſht, as to know that the Heavens do certainly preſage the Events of things, and in this, the Science of the Aſtrologer is certain, but the Event, and effect (as to man) cheifly depends on mans Cooperation and Acting, either as to Good or Evil, theſe things before propounded, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing well and duly weighed, it will appear of how great force and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment to the right ordering and well conſtituting of Human Affaires, the proper Election of fit and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruent times are, and is not in the

                     <p>The two laſt parts of this Argument granted, I begin &amp; Anſwer to the firſt.</p>
                     <p>Here <hi>Alexander de Angelis,</hi> moſt evidently certifies his ſottiſh Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance in Aſtrology, for he knoweth not that the Ruling Stars in the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity, promiſe not good felicity, or good ſucceſs, in every time, but at certaine Definitive times, which time is meaſured by directions, and confirmed by Congruent Revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions; As in the Birth, the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Poſition being Congruent to the Conſtitution of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant, miraculouſly educeth it from the Womb, upon this Worldly Stage, where the Ruling Stars im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>print their Jurisdiction thereon, and ſubject it Influentially to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and ſo the good ſignified in the Nativity being maturated, by direction and Congruent Revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the Caeleſtial figure being anſwerable. By the Poſition of the Heavens, and the proper apt
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:63969:119"/>Tranſits of the Planets, traduceth, <hi>de potentia, in Actum,</hi> from a Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tential poſſibility into Act, which is the moſt true and genuine Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Elections.</p>
                     <p>And farther he knoweth not that in every Nativity both good &amp; bad, and bad as well as good are ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, <hi>(Nulla enim eſt omni ex parte beata, velinfauſta)</hi> no Fortune but is Chequered, (as it were) with good and bad; Its abſurd to think that all miſcheifs and evils ſhould come together, or all good toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or all good, and all evil toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or at one time, to the Native, when could ſuch a time be that a thing thus ſhould hap? Or if at one time, what ſhould be the buſineſs of the remaining time of Life? or why ſhould good rather then evil, or evil rather then good at certain times happen? Therefore muſt needs be granted, that good &amp; evil have their Viciſſitudes, and proper times, as is proved by directions, from whence the falſeneſs of his Aſſertion appears who ſaith what time ſoever, or under what Poſition ſoever you undertake your buſineſs, you may bring
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:63969:120"/>bring it to a happy, and proſperous end.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond is like unto this, where he ſaith, <hi>Let us Elect a time for a long Iourney, by the Poſition of the Heavens, for any perſon, and ſo or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der all things in Art that the Iourney may be as ſuccesful as can be deſired nothing deſired more happy: ſhall this Conſtitution of Heaven indure the whole time of a long Iourney, or no? here it behoves the Heavens to ſtand ſtill, whiles men are moved; who poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble (ſaith he) can beare this madneſs? and ſhall not this Poſition glide away time, where then ſhall be the ſafety of this ſo long Iourney, of Days, or Months? Or whether ſhall it be ſaid a man is thus Planet favoured from the ſtars when he firſt takes Horſe? and if ſo, ſhall the Stars continue this Luckie ſafety, and ſuceſs the whole time of the Iourney? Do you think ſo, doth not he that takes a long Iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, every day aſcend his Horſe Affreſh? Why how comes it then that he is diarily affected with variety of chances according to the various Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of ſecondary Cauſes? What
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:63969:120"/>profiteth then a Lucky, or an unlucky beginning of a Iourney? Neither can Aſtrologers make good to him that takes this Iourney, when the Stars ſhall make good his way, nor clear the way from Theives, nor by diſperſing the Clouds temperate the heat of the Sun, and give him a pleaſant Air, nor ſupport his Horſe from ſtumbling, and him from falling, nor the way by equalling the Hills and Vallys, all which things the Heavens and the Stars muſt performe if they, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Theſe things equally deſerve Laughter &amp; are rediculous with the former, and altogether unbecom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Learned man; as I ſhall make plainly appear, That <hi>Alexander de Angelis</hi> knew not wherein the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity of a Journey doth conſiſt, I demand of him whether the Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney that the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> made to viſit <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> was proſperous and happy?

                        <hi>I Anſwer,</hi> The ſame abſurdity may be demanded concerning the Figure of Heaven under which any one is ſaid to be happily Born, which truly continueth not in the World, by a quieſcent ſtationary Conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Heavens, ſo long as the Native lives, but is infixed on the Native, by its firſt Impreſſion, and indures in the Heaven by its Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination; To that which <hi>Iohannes de Angelis</hi> Queſits, whether a man be Fortunated by a Lucky Influence the time he takes Horſe, and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that Aſtreal Fortunate Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, ſhall continue and preſerve him Fortunate all his Life long?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>In Anſwer,</hi> Conſidering rationally the Subject matter of this Diſcourſe, the ſame abſurdity is here as in the
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:63969:122"/>former; here <hi>De Angelis</hi> urgeth meer Nugacious trifles, and fooliſh Suppoſitions, where as the truth is the contrary to his Suggeſtion: for in the Sympathy of man the Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtial Bodys powerfully operating, the preſent Conſtitution of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, at the time of Birth, is the only Rule of all the concernments of man during his Natural Life, for as man generally at his production into the World is ſubjected to a certaine Determinate Influence of the Stars, for his whole Life, not that he putteth himſelf Diaryly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a New Subjection or changeth, with the unutterrable Mutations changes of the Heavens, as is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent from experience in the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Genius, Inclination, Wit and manner of Action, in every one; from hence it comes to paſs, that a man entring or beginning any Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or buſineſs, Congruent to the Radical Poſition of the Heavens at the Birth, and conformable to the Radical direction, and Annual Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution, by a Figure of Election, aptly and properly made for the
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:63969:122"/>moment of time in which he begins his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires receives from the Heavens, an Actuall particular Aſtreal Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, to the perfecting and finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this work begun, in like manner as the Aſtreal Influx ſignates, Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentially in the Radix, which power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Influence by conſequence, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues in effect ſo long time, as is requiſite to the perfecting and fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing this Enterpriſe ſo begun, not changing every day, for ſo there would be no Caeleſtial power to fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh and perfect a Buſineſs, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to begin if ſo be, every day, and hour, the various Influences ſhould be variouſly operated upon the Action, or buſineſs begun cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, becauſe the Caeleſtial Radij, as well by the conſtant motion of the Sphear, as the proper motion of the Planets, is ſo variable, that nothing could be brought to any Fortunate effect, or at leaſtwiſe make diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruous and diſorderly progreſſion; ſo alſo in all things the Radical Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure in the Nativity ſhould be falſe, as alſo in long Journeys Fortunated, by a good Election, which ſhall after
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:63969:123"/>appear to be moſt falſe, the ſame validity in other Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
                     <p>But one Objection remains, that carrys more ſeeming force, and validity as thus, be Heavens not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly preſignify future Accidents to each Perſon Born, but alſo the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular time of the Accidents, by their Revolutions, and directions, which is a truth fully in Art evinc'd; Therefore the Heavenly Influences ſhall in thoſe particular deſired times, effect and accompliſh what they have Signified, or not accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh it, if ſo, then whatſoever is ſaid of Election of Days or Hours is ſuperfluous, vaine and of no effect.</p>
                     <p>But to this I Anſwer, the Decrees of Heaven are not of Fatal neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, eſpecially in free Actions, but in their effects depend upon the Cooperation of mans will which they incline, and excite in apt and certain time but not Determine and Limit, for this time hath a cerraine Latitude, in the Compaſs of which a man may Determine and reſolve
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:63969:123"/>of himſelf, <hi>ad agendum,</hi> as to Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Now ſeeing that during this ſucceſſion of time, the places of the Planets have their viciſitudes and are continually changing, and the Face of Heaven admits of much variation every hour; It can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be denyed but that in the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking every Action, as a long Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, or the like, that ſhall always be the moſt happy, and cheifly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperous, which is accomodated and favoured by the Heavens, and to which the Aſtreal Influence, doth moſt conveniently concur, and this only is accompliſht by Elections: therefore Elections are greatly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable, nay rather neceſſary to the obtaining the more happy, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired event, of every conſiderable Action.</p>
                     <p>Many other frivilous Objections urged by the Ignorant Enemies of Art I might here trouble the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der with, but being ſo weak not worth the Anſwering, I ſhall for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear to ſpend Paper and pains, on ſo uſeleſs a matter, altogether diſliking Fictitious Tautalogies.</p>

                     <p>THoſe Things being premiſed that we hitherto Diſcourſt of, its covenient that we ſubjoyn cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain General Rules neceſſary to be underſtood, for the apt forming of Elections, wherein is ſhewed how in the General a fit and Fortunate Election of time, for every occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion is to be made, theſe following Rules we have ſelegated, and choſen out of various Authors, eſpecially the <hi>Arabians,</hi> which we have ſound mixt with many vain and frivolus Poſitions, and here render them in order for the greater facillity of Learning, and working, principally
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:63969:124"/>applying thoſe which are valid to our purpoſe, and neglecting thoſe pertinent.</p>
                     <p>But here we are to take Notice, that theſe Rules are not ſimply, and abſolutely ſufficient to ground E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lections upon, as the <hi>Arabians,</hi> and thoſe that cloſely follow them af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme, but always we are to have an eye, with due regard to the Nativi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Perſon, and conſidering thoſe things which depend upon that, with the time of Election; as alſo reſpect is to be had to the Radi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Directions the Revolutions of the ☉ and <g ref="char:Moon">☽</g> and their directions, as ſo the diary Tranſits of the Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets.</p>
                     <div type="section">
                        <head>Let therefore this be the firſt Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</head>
                        <p>That every able and ſufficient E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection be made by inſpecting the Geneſis, or Nativity,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> or the Revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Directions, and Tranſits of the Planets, the Radical places of the Nativity and Revolutions, acco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modating every thing herein, as much as may be to the ſcope of Elections.</p>

                        <p>Secondly, Seriouſly it is to be conſidered to what Houſe of the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure the thing belongs, for which you would make an Election (which you may finde in the Introductive, part) if it be Dignity or Honour it belongs to the <hi>10th.</hi> Houſe, if a Wife to the <hi>7th.</hi> if a long Journey to the <hi>9th.</hi> if a ſhort Journey to the <hi>3d.</hi> &amp;c. And if an Election of time were made for the obtaining of Dignity and Preferment, <hi>Schonerus</hi> and others make choice of that time when the Progreſſions of the Horo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcope, <hi>Medium Coeli,</hi> and the ☉ and <g ref="char:Moon">☽</g> Radically ſhall be in the <hi>10th.</hi> Houſe of the Radix, but this obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of Profections and Progreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on we finde invalid; therefore chuſe that time in which the Directions of the Horoſcope, <hi>Med Coeli,</hi> ☉ and <g ref="char:Moon">☽</g>, and all the Lords in the Revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the ☉ and <g ref="char:Moon">☽</g> ſhall come to the <hi>10th.</hi> of the Radix, or his For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate Aſpect, or to a Benevolent Planet therein, or to the Lord of the <hi>10th.</hi> Houſe, or to the place, or good Aſpects of the ☉ and <g ref="char:Moon">☽</g> in the Radix, or the Lords thereof, or to

                        <p>Thirdly, in the Figure of Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, reſpect is cheifly to be had, to the Horoſcope, the Significator of the Perſon for whom the Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is made, of the <hi>Mid</hi> Heaven like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe which hath the Signification of the Actions and undertakings of the Perſon, as alſo to that Houſe of the Figure, to which the matter belongs, for which the Election is made, to the Moon likewiſe who claimes rightly, much in our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration in Every Election, that ſhe be well poſited, well affected, &amp; Aſpected from and by the other Planets, and not afflicted, for ſpecial care is to be had leaſt the Radical places beforeſaid, <hi>viz.</hi> The Horo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcope,

                        <p>Fourthly,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> in your Figure of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection, take care that the Houſe which hath the Signification of the thing for which the Election is made, be Fortunate in the hour of Election, and if it ſo fall out that it be Fortunate in the Nativity, and in the Revolution of the ☉ and <g ref="char:Moon">☽</g> that doth highly promiſe good ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs: moreover it ſhall be Fortuna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the preſence, or Dominion of Benevolent Planets, which Radi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally, and Revolutionally, were by Nature Benevolents and well af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, and rightly determined in body, Dominion, or a Congruent Aſpect to the thing for the which the Election is made, which if the Election be for Dignity and Honor, and the Signe of the <hi>10th.</hi> of the Nativity, or preſent Revolution culminate in the Figure of Election or that Signe in which the Lord of the <hi>10th.</hi> was in in either of them,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:63969:126"/>the Election is much the better, and the more efficacious, and ſo of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers but cheifly you ſhall take care that no Planet, Evil by Nature or by Radical Poſition, &amp; contrary in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to the ſcope of your Election, be in the Houſe of Election <hi>(i.e.)</hi> the Houſe fignifying your buſineſs, but carefully indeavour that a Benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Planet be admitted or poſited therein, or that the Lord of that Houſe Fortunately, by Dominion or Aſpect be united, or joyned with the Horoſcope or the <hi>Medium Coeli</hi> or their, or either of their Lords or Governing Planets.</p>

<pb n="193" facs="tcp:63969:199"/>ſell deer, and it is the opinion of good Authors, that this Rule holds not only in Beaſts and Cattel, but in all things that any one can buy or ſell whatſoever, always, not preter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting or forgetting that Fortunes meliorate, and augment the good, and diminiſh the evil of a thing, and contrary the infortunes, always augment the evil, and dimiſh the good, every one both good and bad, according to his nature, and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the vertue and power they have, to help, or hurt, to augment, or diminiſh.</item>
